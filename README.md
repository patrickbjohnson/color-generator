#Color Generator
The idea is to generate a primary color for quick use. Often times I just need a color to initiate the process of design. While the color does matter, in some projects (at least personally) it doesn't matter immediately. 

##How can you use color? 
- As a placeholder for a module of content that you know will have color eventually
- As a piece of inspiration. Lets say you want to create a random color palette, pick the first color randomly as well. 
- To spice up a otherwise bland layout or design. 
- However else you'd like to use it.
